# IBM_HR_Attrition-Python-
Objective:
To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover.

To perform clustering to find any meaningful patterns of employee traits.

To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.

To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees.

The implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.

Prescriptive Analytics - What should we do?

The Problem:
One of the most common problems at work is turnover.

Replacing a worker earning about 50,000 dollars cost the company about 10,000 dollars or 20% of that workerâ€™s yearly income according to the Center of American Progress.

Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that...

Cost include:

Cost of off-boarding
Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)
Annual Cost of Turnover = (Hiring + Onboarding + Development + Unfilled Time) * (# Employees x Annual Turnover Percentage)

Annual Cost of Turnover = (1,000 + 500) x (15,000 * 24%)

Annual Cost of Turnover) = 1500 x 3600

Annual Cost of Turnover) = 5400000

Example
Jobs (earning under 30k a year): the cost to replace a 10/hour retail employee would be 3,328 dollars.
Jobs (earning 30k-50k a year) - the cost to replace a 40k manager would be 8,000 dollars.
Jobs of executives (earning 100k+ a year) - the cost to replace a 100k CEO is 213,000 dollars.
